# Bank-Frauds-Neural-Network

### Midterm Project for the Deep Learning & Neural Networks class of my MSc in AI Systems.

Focused on:<br>
• The preprocessing steps<br>
• The building of the neural network<br>
• The use of the tools seen in class <br>
• The quality of the Notebook (comments, structure ...)<br>
• The performances of the model<br>

### The dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/code/turkayavci/fraud-detection-on-bank-payments

Professor's feedback: Good preprocessing step and the neural network concepts are well understood ! It might be interesting to do oversampling to improve your model.
